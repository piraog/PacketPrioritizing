class Network:
    '''This class defines a network, and creates one according to given parameters. 
    It will later be used as an input for our simulation.
        Args:
            * nNodes (int): The number of nodes in the network
            * nFlows (int): The number of flows we generate (going from one node to the gateway, they define the static routing/scheduling for regular packets)

        Kwargs:
            * nChannels (int): the number of channels the nodes can use (basicaly the number of transmissions that can occur at the same time between 2 pairs of nodes)
            * eFork (int): the expectancy of the Poisson law used to determine the number of connections exiting a node
            * schedulingMethod (str): the method used to schedule the regular flows (FCFS or Round Robin)
        Attributes:
            * connectionTable : nNode*nNode map of all existing connections between nodes
            * H : list of each flow path  
            * W : list of dictionaries, for each node:  {time of leaving : destination, flowID, arrival}
            * A : list of dictionaries, for each node:  {flowID : time of leaving, destination, arrival}
            * flows : list of the flows parameters, for each flow: [number of hops, arrival time, deadline]
            * transmissionView : list of every transmission occuring at each time step
            * globalPeriod : period of the entire schedule
            * utilisationRate : utilisation rate of the network (ration of occupied transmission slots)
